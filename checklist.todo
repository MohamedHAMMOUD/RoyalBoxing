@How 
Don't aim for perfection in the first go. Instead, aim to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) =>
Learn by doing: When you come across a task that you don't know how to do, take the time to research and learn. 
This could be reading documentation, following tutorials, or looking at examples of similar projects =>
Code review (ChatGPT or online communities) => Iterate : improve upon your work incrementally => Repeat.
